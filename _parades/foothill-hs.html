The Foothill Marching Band and Guard will be performing this April at the Cherry Blossom
Festival in Washington DC.
The Directors, Staff, and students would also like to thank the foothill booster program and
parents for all of their work throughout the season, as well as the Pleasanton Unified School
District Administration for their continued support of our music in our schools.
