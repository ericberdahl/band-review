The Marching Eagles are competing in their 5th year as a marching band. Under the Direction of Mr. Richard Winkler, the band has been very successful in their class, placing consistently at their reviews. This year, the band took 3rd place at the Pitman High School Preview of Champions. The band would like to thank all the school administration for their continued support of music education at Turlock Christian Schools.
