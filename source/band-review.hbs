                    Hey Josh Woo, on the way home pick up a gallon of milk, a loaf of bread and some cereal.
                    Pick any cereal you want except Cap' N Crunch.
                    That always cuts the roof of my mouth.
                    Oh what the heck, you only live once.
                    Get the Cap'N Crunch with Crunch Berries.
                    I'm a pickle!
                    Long live PICKLE RICK!!!
