                    To the Foothill Pit Gang: I’m super proud of y’all and how much this pit has grown since I graduated.
                    I can’t wait to come see your show in person (maybe sooner than you think).


                    To Joshie: Just wanted to say I’m also proud of your growth as a musician.
                    You’ve accomplished a lot from the moment you decided you were too cool to do percussion like your sister.
                    I’ll return from SLO to bug you soon!


                    Much love,
                    Melanie (snacklord)
