        Whether you're from Foothill or cheering your home school, you probably know how much work it takes to hold a successful band review, where student performers can share their talent with and their love of music. Today, {{ site.data.parade.count }} bands marched in parade, {{ site.data.concert.count }} performed in concert, and {{ site.data.field.count }} presented field shows. All this would not happen without the work of several hundred student and parent volunteers. Foothill High School thanks everyone who contributed to the success of today's Band Review. You all made it happen!
