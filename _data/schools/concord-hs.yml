        The guard placed second at the Granada Winter Fiesta last weekend. They are hoping to show improvement today in
        both their technique and presentation. The "Mauvelous Moonstone" Brigade would also like to thank Leslie,
        Cassie, Teagan, and Marena for their efforts as student leaders. You are loved and appreciated.
