    notes: >
        The students and staff of the Vintage High "Crusher" Marching Band would like to thank
        all the Vintage Music Boosters for their unconditional services and support to make our
        music program a fulfilling and rewarding experience. Without the Music Boosters, this
        program simply would not happen.
