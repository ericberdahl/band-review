This concludes the {{show.citation}}.
Thank you and congratulations to all the bands weâ€™ve seen today, and thank you all for attending and cheering on these fine young performers.

Mark your calendars to join us again next year, on {{next_show.date}}, for the {{next_show.citation}}.
On behalf of Foothill High School, I wish you all a safe and enjoyable weekend. Good night.
