    notes: >
        This is the Puma Marching Band's second year being a competitive marching band and being the only public high school competitive marching band in San Francisco.
        The Burton Band was also nominated by Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi to represent our community and California in the National Independence Day Parade in Washington DC next summer.
        All of this wouldn't be possible without the amazing support of the Burton Band Boosters, Burton High School Admin and SFUSD.
