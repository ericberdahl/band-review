        Please join us in celebrating 60 years of Del Mar High School's award winning Marching Band and Colorguard!!
        None of this would be possible without the amazing Parent Support Team who raise money, provide meals, and sew surprise garments for us!
        They also want to thank their hosts at both Amador Valley this morning and here at Foothill High School for hosting this seminal event every year.
