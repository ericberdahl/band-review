    notes: >
        After many years, the Oakmont Royal Blue Regiment returns to Foothill.
        Mr. Everts and his students thank the parents very much for all they do to help support the organization.
        Also, they thank Foothill High School for hosting the event.
        Oakmont hosts an event, as well, and knows how much work it takes to host a field show competition.
        Last year, there were 42 students in band with 14 freshmen.
        This year...57 students with 27 freshmen.
        This year will be the first year for 65% of the band ever competing in a field show!  Very exciting!  

        On a personal note, Mr. Everts returns to the Tri-Valley.
        From 2008-2017, Mr. Everts was the Dublin High School instrumental music teacher.
        He wishes the new Dublin High School Instrumental Music Teacher, Mr. Polot and his students and organization the very best.
