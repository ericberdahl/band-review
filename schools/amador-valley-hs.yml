        The Marching Dons would like to thank their parents, the Sea of Purple in the stands tonight for your love and support.
        They would also like to acknowledge principal Josh Butterfield, superintendent David Haglund and the larger Pleasanton community for their commitment to music.
        The Marching Dons wish all of the competing bands good skill tonight!
