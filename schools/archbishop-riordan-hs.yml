    notes: >
        Archbishop Riordan High School is a private, Archdiocesan Catholic high school in the Marianist tradition.
        The band program prides itself in having one of the longest-running and largest marching bands in the city of San Francisco and owes its success to the school’s beginning band courses.
        Over 80% of the students you see in front of you today began learning their instrument as a Freshman at Riordan!
        The band as a whole would like to thank the Foothill High School Band, faculty, staff, and parents for providing this tremendous opportunity to perform.
        And of course, Mr. Hildebrant and Mr. Ohnmeiss would like to give a big shout out to the Riordan Band Boosters!
        Without you, none of this would be possible!
