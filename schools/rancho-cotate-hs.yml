    program: What Goes Upâ€¦Must Come Down!

    description: >
        Everything that goes up must come down.
        When feeling down we must elevate our emotions, filling both our mind and our spirits, up with joy.
        Like the sun rises and the sun sets, like our emotions rise and fall....what goes up must come down.

    music: >
        the music of Destiny's Child, Alicia Keys, and Jordan Sparks.
        Arranged by Dustin Friel and edited by Abel Moya

    notes: >
        The band says thank you to our families and friends who have supported us this season.
        Thank you to all local businesses that have helped us out as well.
        And a very special thank you to the RCHS Music Boosters for your unparalleled support this fall season.
