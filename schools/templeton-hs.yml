    notes: >
        The Templeton Talon Drum and Brass Corps is one of a small handful of all-brass high school marching bands in the country,
        a distinction they have held since 2008.
        Since its founding, the band has consistently earned top honors in shows around California including second place in the
        2021 WBA Regional Championships, first place overall at the 2016 Selma Rotary Band Festival,
        and first place at the Cambria Pinedorado Parade for the past 5 years. 

        The band would like to thank the THS Band Boosters and its major sponsor, Castoro Cellars and the Whale Rock Music Festival.
