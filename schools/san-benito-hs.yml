    notes: >
        This is the Scarlet Regiment's first return to the field show genre since 2007 on the heels of
        many years of success in parade venues. With the constant help of the Baler Band Boosters and
        SBHS administration, the Scarlet Regiment is excited to take on this new challenge and
        opportunity. The students you see before you are a volunteer half of the band program which is
        comprised of two concert bands, winter guard, percussion ensemble, and jazz band.
