    program: Don't Look Up

    description: >
        A fascinating discovery brings us into a very perplexing situation.
        As a large comet is barreling toward Earth, we have to decide whether to defend ourselves or accept the inevitable.
        As tensions are high, many people are starting to accept there is no hope and that mankind will end in total annihilation.
        Come with us through our journey of passion and fear as the Lion Pride Marching Band takes us through "Don't Look Up"

    music: >
