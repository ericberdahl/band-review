    description: >
        This year, the Cal High Marching Band is taking a journey through iconic imagery and musical themes of the wild western frontier.
        Our show seeks to evoke a sense of wonder and adventure, from scenes of gorgeous plateaus and sunsets to the dangerous,
        crime-ridden towns of the old west.
        Fueled by the iconic spaghetti western themes from the late Ennio Morricone, as well as the popular tune "Wanted:Dead or Alive" by Bon Jovi,
        we hope you enjoy our journey into the wild west.
