    program: Under the Stars

        "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star",

    description: >
        Our 2022 production "Under the Stars” captures the imagination that one feels when looking up into a gorgeous, unobstructed night sky.
        Utilizing the motifs of a star-filled sky, constellations, and shooting stars, our show hopes to awaken a sense of awe and wonderment
        of what we can see and what lies beyond a star-filled sky.

    notes: >
        Cal High would like to thank their amazing Instrumental Music Boosters, incredible instructional staff, and all family, and friends
        for their support of the Cal High Marching Band and Color Guard Program. We couldn't do this without you!
