    notes: >
        We've been invited to both Carnegie and Davies Symphony Hall to perform our pieces in the past.
        Our band holds national prestige ever since we performed in Annapolis, which we constantly regard with honor and respect.
        Additionally, last year, our jazz band received a score of 99 overall, gaining us first place in the jazz band category.
        Not to mention that we consistently send individuals to the Honor Band of America for the past 12 years, including our current lead drum major, Barry.
