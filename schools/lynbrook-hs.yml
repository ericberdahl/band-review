    notes: >
        The Lynbrook Marching Viking Band and Colorguard has been a finalist band at numerous BOA regionals throughout the past decade.
        In 2019, Lynbrook took Field Show Sweepstakes at the Napa Vintage Band Review.
        Lynbrook ensembles have a long history of international travel, with an upcoming trip planned to the United Kingdom in June 2022.
        The Lynbrook Orchestra has been invited to perform at CASMEC and at the Midwest Clinic.
        The Vikings would like to thank LIMB, our parent booster organization, for all their support!
