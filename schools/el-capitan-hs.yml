    notes: >
        The Gaucho Marching Brigade is celebrating its tenth year of existence.
        In that short time, they have won numerous sweepstakes awards, and the guard has traveled to Dayton Ohio for WGI world championships three times.
        They would like to give a huge thank you to the music boosters, friends, families, and Merced Union High School District administration for making their participation here today possible.
