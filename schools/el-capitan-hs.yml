    notes: >
        The Gaucho Marching Brigade is in its seventh year of existence, and for the last four years has placed first in their division or won sweepstakes at every single band review they've entered.
        They would like to give a huge thank you to the music boosters, friends, families, and Merced Union High School District administration for making their participation here today possible.
