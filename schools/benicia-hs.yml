    notes: >
        The Benicia Panther Band has been the recipient of countless first place and sweepstakes awards throughout it's long history of musical excellence.
        The students and staff would like to thank the entire community of Benicia for supporting music in schools and would especially like to thank the Panther Band Boosters.
        Without the hard work and dedication of our booster program, none of this would be possible.
        Please welcome, the pride of Benicia California, the Benicia High School Panther Band!
