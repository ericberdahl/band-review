    program: The RISE of Medusa

    description: >
        This years Emerald Brigade production is titled “The RISE of Medusa”.
        It tells the story of Medusa from the mortal innocent child and through the anger of Poseidon's advances.
        In the middle production you will hear the conflict between Medusa and Poseidon and then the jealousy of Athena
        as she eventually curses Medusa to be an immortal monster forever.
        The slow production communicates the hurt that Medusa feels when her friend has destroyed her life and is the Monster Athena created.
        Our featured vocalist is Chloe Jordan and our featured sax soloist is Austin Hailey.
        The final production starts with the Rise of Medusa and ends with her appearing again just like the beginning of the show.
        She is a powerful and strong Godess who has accepted her fate.
        We hope you enjoy “The RISE of Medusa”
