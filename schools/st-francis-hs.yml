    description: >
        Tethered explores the many connective bonds in our life (emotional, mental and physical) that can affect how we live.
        Strong bonds can often leave us feeling trapped and desiring to break free.
        Throughout the show, we explore how what may initially seem to restrain us can transform into bonds that strengthen and unite.
