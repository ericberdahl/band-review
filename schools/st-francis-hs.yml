    description: >
        The world is alive with color in our exciting show!
        We explore the character of each color on the color wheel, beginning with the fiery, Latin-inspired “Fury (Red/Orange)”,
        followed by jazzy strains of “The Royal Blues (Blue/Purple)”,
        before finishing with the vibrant, rhythmic “Life (Yellow/Green)."
