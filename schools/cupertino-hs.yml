    description: >
        That one second, during a brief eternity, where you are looking back on a memory and everything stops.
        You are presented with a decisionâ€¦ what would you do in that seemingly infinite stillness and how will you react when you realize time is running out?
        Cupertino's 2022 production takes us through that journey and forces us to look inward with a lens that helps us realize that how we spend our time is everything.

    notes: >
        The students and staff of the Cupertino High School Proud Pioneer Band would like to thank their amazing band boosters for all they do.
        Without them, wonderful nights of music like tonight would not be possible.
        They would also like to thank Mr. Efrain Hinojosa, his band program, and the Foothill Band Boosters for hosting a great event.
        Lastly, they would like to wish all bands a safe and successful season.
        March in step, play in tune, and watch your drum major!
