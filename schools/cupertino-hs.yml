    description: >
        In movement one, the experience of starting on a path.
        Movement two, realizing you have veered off course and are lost.
        Movement three, then, with determination, you commit to find your way back and finally, the exhilaration of when you are back. 

    notes: >
        The students and staff would like to thank their awesome parent boosters for all they do.
        Without them, nights of wonderful music like tonight would not be possible.
