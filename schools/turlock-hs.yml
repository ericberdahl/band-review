    notes: >
        The Turlock High Bulldog Band and Colorguard is in their third year of rebuilding after the program was eliminated in 2015.
        During the last three years the band has participated in numerous band reviews and local parades and had the honor
        of performing on Main Street in Downtown Disney last spring.
        The Band and Guard wishes to thank their administrators and band boosters for their unwavering support.
