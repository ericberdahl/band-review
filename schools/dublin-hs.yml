    program: "The Wolves Within"

    music: >
        The Wolves Within by Zeke David and Steve Martin. Percussion by Chris Cyr and Connor Carrol.

    description: >
        The Wolves Within is about two wolves battling inside you.
        One is evil; it is anger, jealousy, sorrow, greed.
        The other is good; it is joy, peace, love.
        Which wolf wins?
        The one that you feed.

    notes: >
        The Dublin High School Irish Guard marching band and colorguard would like to thank its incredible boosters and school administration who work tirelessly to help the students' hard work come to fruition.
