    program: Take Me Higher

    music: >
        original music written by Thomas Bergensen, Will Pitts, Scott Stapp, Mark Tremonti, and Anna Meredith

    description: >
        Take Me Higher is an exploration of height and depth, and how it manifests in different ways.
        In order to reach one's highest point, there must be a lowest point.
        The show begins peacefully and serenely, symbolizing an upwards ascent, but progresses towards grand and surreal impacts,
        a metaphor for the journey to and wonder of reaching new heights.
        As Take Me Higher enters the final movement, it becomes filled with a sense of newfound joy and nostalgia,
        as one realizes that the exploration of height and the depth that serves as its counterpart are lifelong journeys of
        limitless potential.
