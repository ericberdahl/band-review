    notes: >
        The Freedom High School Falcon Marching Band is an active program within the community, performing at local parades
        and reviews, and it's mission is to enrich the musical education of each student through performance opportunities
        and community outreach.
        They offer Wind Bands, Jazz Band, Orchestra, Percussion, and guitar classes that collaborate with other programs on
        campus to spread the joy and excellence of music.
        The band would like to extend their deepest appreciation to our Band and Guard Boosters who make all of these
        opportunities possible through their dedication and support to our program.
