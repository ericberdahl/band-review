    description: >
        Fly With Me to Paradise is dedicated to an Arroyo High school Student who recently passed away.
        He had been a current Arroyo HS Music Department until his passing, and who performed instruments from saxophone to timpani.
        A very brave and outgoing person who loved to play music, he lived life to its fullest!
        We are deeply saddened by his passing and will always remember him.
        It’s not goodbye, but until we meet again.

    notes: >
        The Arroyo Marching Dons are grateful for the never-ending support of our Music Boosters.
        Thank you, parents, for making this a great season for us!
