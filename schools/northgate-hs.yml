    notes: >
        The Marching Broncos are happy to be back at the Foothill Band Review.
        After a COVID hiatus, they competed in the 1A division last year, earning three First Place awards at their three competitions.
        Coming back this year, they are incredibly happy to see the continual growth of the band, and adding a color guard to the
        program this year has been one of the highlights of the season.
        The Broncos would like to thank Foothill and Amador Valley High for hosting this wonderful event, and the Northgate Instrumental
        Music Boosters for their continuous and relentless support.
        Thanks to you, we are Bronco Strong!
