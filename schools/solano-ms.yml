    notes: >
        Throughout history, mankind, has been in constant turmoil, constant battle, constant confict, chaos, a never ending struggle of ideology and power.
        Is there a future? Is there determination, commitment, sacrifice for the good of all?
        Will "mankind" ever find a solution of Peace, Equality, Justice, and Liberty for All???
        Are we doomed to, once again, live and struggle in another era of Broken Times?
