        The Saratoga High School Marching Band performed in the 2016 Tournament of Roses Parade, as well as the 2012 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.
        The Band has been a Class 2A Champion for 5 years at the Bands of America Regional Competitions,
        and in 2015 were the overall Bands of America West Coast Regional Champion.
        In Summer 2022, the Saratoga High School Symphonic Wind Ensemble will be featured performers at the Mid-Europe International Wind Music Festival in Schladming, Austria;
        the Imago Festival in Ljubljana, Slovenia; the Musikverein in Vienna, Austria; and the WASBE Fringe Festival in Prague, the Czech Republic. 

        The Saratoga High School Marching Band would like to extend heartfelt appreciation to all of the parents, families, friends, Saratoga High School Alumni, Principal Greg Louie, and Saratoga High community members for unyielding support.
        The Saratoga High School Marching Band would also like to thank Cupertino High School and all volunteers for helping make the Cupertino Tournament of Bands possible every year,
        as well as the Northern California Band Association for providing educational performance opportunities annually to thousands of students.
